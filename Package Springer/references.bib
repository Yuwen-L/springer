While many questions can be answered by modeling the various outcomes separately, some questions can only be answered in a joint analysis of all of them. In this article, we will present a review of the many approaches proposed in the statistical literature. Four main model families will be presented, discussed and compared. Focus will be on presenting advantages and disadvantages of the different models rather than on the mathematical or computational details. }

	We review the rationale behind and discuss methods of design and analysis of genetic association studies. There are similarities between genetic association studies and classic epidemiological studies of environmental risk factors but there are also issues that are specific to studies of genetic risk factors such as the use of particular family-based designs, the need to account for different underlying genetic mechanisms, and the effect of population history. Association differs from linkage (covered elsewhere in this series) in that the alleles of interest will be the same across the whole population. As with other types of genetic epidemiological study, issues of design, statistical analysis, and interpretation are very important."

	abstract={High-dimensional longitudinal data arise frequently in biomedical and genomic research. It is important to select relevant covariates when the dimension of the parameters diverges as the sample size increases.We propose the penalized quadratic inference function to perform model selection and estimation simultaneously in the framework of a diverging number of regression parameters. The penalized quadratic inference function can easily take correlation information from clustered data into account, yet it does not require specifying the likelihood function. This is advantageous compared to existing model selection methods for discrete data with large cluster size. In addition, the proposed approach enjoys the oracle property; it is able to identify non-zero components consistently with probability tending to 1, and any finite linear combination of the estimated non-zero components has an asymptotic normal distribution. We propose an efficient algorithm by selecting an effective tuning parameter to solve the penalized quadratic inference function. Monte Carlo simulation studies have the proposed method selecting the correct model with a high frequency and estimating covariate effects accurately even when the dimension of parameters is high. We illustrate the proposed approach by analyzing periodontal disease data.},

Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the pioposecl estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

	abstract = {Generalised estimating equations enable one to estimate regression parameters consistently in longitudinal data analysis even when the correlation structure is misspecified. However, under such misspecification, the estimator of the regression parameter can be inefficient. In this paper we introduce a method of quadratic inference functions that does not involve direct estimation of the correlation parameter, and that remains optimal even if the working correlation structure is misspecified. The idea is to represent the inverse of the working correlation matrix by the linear combination of basis matrices, a representation that is valid for the working correlations most commonly used. Both asymptotic theory and simulation show that under misspecified working assumptions these estimators are more efficient than estimators from generalised estimating equations. This approach also provides a chi-squared inference function for testing nested models and a chi-squared regression misspecification test. Furthermore, the test statistic follows a chi-squared distribution asymptotically whether or not the working correlation structure is correctly specified.},

Robust methods are needed to tackle these challenges. When there are a large number of predictors, variable selection can be as important as estimation. As a generic variable selection and regularization tool, penalization has been extensively adopted. In this article, we provide a selective review of robust penalized variable selection approaches especially designed for high-dimensional data from bioinformatics and biomedical studies. We discuss the robust loss functions, penalty functions and computational algorithms. The theoretical properties and implementation are also briefly examined.

Such analysis is challenging because of the high data dimensionality, lack of knowledge regulating CNVs for a specific GE, different behaviors of the cis-acting and trans-acting CNVs, possible long-tailed distributions and contamination of GE measurements, and correlations between CNVs. The existing methods fail to address one or more of these challenges. In this study, a new method is developed to model more effectively the GEâCNV associations. Specifically, for each GE, a partially linear model, with a nonlinear cis-acting CNV effect, is assumed. A robust loss function is adopted to accommodate long-tailed distributions and data contamination. We adopt penalization to accommodate the high dimensionality and identify relevant CNVs. A network structure is introduced to accommodate the correlations among CNVs. The proposed method comprehensively accommodates multiple challenging characteristics of GEâCNV modeling and effectively overcomes the limitations of existing methods. We develop an effective computational algorithm and rigorously establish the consistency properties. Simulation shows the superiority of the proposed method over alternatives. The TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data on the PCD (programmed cell death) pathway are analyzed, and the proposed method has improved prediction and stability and biologically plausible findings."

	abstract = "Background
	Genome-wide association studies have yet to identify the majority of genetic variants involved in asthma. We hypothesized that expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping can identify novel asthma genes by enabling prioritization of putative functional variants for association testing.
	Objective
	We evaluated 6706 cis-acting expression-associated variants (eSNPs) identified through a genome-wide eQTL survey of CD4+ lymphocytes for association with asthma.
	Methods
	eSNPs were tested for association with asthma in 359 asthmatic patients and 846 control subjects from the Childhood Asthma Management Program, with verification by using family-based testing. Significant associations were tested for replication in 579 parent-child trios with asthma from Costa Rica. Further functional validation was performed by using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR in lung-derived epithelial cell lines (Beas-2B and A549) and Jurkat cells, a leukemia cell line derived from T lymphocytes.
	Results
	Cis-acting eSNPs demonstrated associations with asthma in both cohorts. We confirmed the previously reported association of ORMDL3/GSDMB variants with asthma (combined PÂ = 2.9 Ã 10â8). Reproducible associations were also observed for eSNPs in 3 additional genes: fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2; PÂ = .002), N-acetyl-Î±-D-galactosaminidase (NAGA; PÂ = .0002), and Factor XIII, A1 (F13A1; PÂ = .0001). Subsequently, we demonstrated that FADS2 mRNA is increased in CD4+ lymphocytes in asthmatic patients and that the associated eSNPs reside within DNA segments with histone modifications that denote open chromatin status and confer enhancer activity.
	Conclusions
	Our results demonstrate the utility of eQTL mapping in the identification of novel asthma genes and provide evidence for the importance of FADS2, NAGA, and F13A1 in the pathogenesis of asthma."

	abstract={Nonparametric varying coefficient models are useful for the analysis of repeated measurements. While many procedures have been developed for estimating varying-coefficients, there have been few results on variable selection for such models. Recently, Wang, Chen and Li (2007) proposed a group SCAD procedure for model selection in varying-coefficient models, and Wang, Li and Huang (2008) established the existence of a local minimizer of the group SCAD criterion that has the oracle property. However, whether the final estimator from the gSCAD procedure via local quadratic approximation always finds the desired local minimizer is not clear. In this paper, by linearizing the gSCAD penalty we propose a one-step estimator that has the oracle property in variable selection and estimation. The proposed estimator has a much simpler implementation and gives better performance in variable selection and estimation than the ordinary gSCAD estimator.},

	abstract={The genetic influences on complex disease traits generally depend on the joint effects of multiple genetic variants, environmental factors, as well as their interplays. GeneÂ {\texttimes}Â environment (GÂ {\texttimes}Â E) interactions play vital roles in determining an individual's disease risk, but the underlying genetic machinery is poorly understood. Traditional analysis assuming linear relationship between genetic and environmental factors, along with their interactions, is commonly pursued under the regression-based framework to examine GÂ {\texttimes}Â E interactions. This assumption, however, could be violated due to nonlinear responses of genetic variants to environmental stimuli. As an extension to our previous work on continuous traits, we proposed a flexible varying-coefficient model for the detection of nonlinear GÂ {\texttimes}Â E interaction with binary disease traits. Varying coefficients were approximated by a non-parametric regression function through which one can assess the nonlinear response of genetic factors to environmental changes. A group of statistical tests were proposed to elucidate various mechanisms of GÂ {\texttimes}Â E interaction. The utility of the proposed method was illustrated via simulation and real data analysis with application to type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {For many complex diseases, gene-environment (G-E) interactions have independent contributions beyond the main G and E effects. Despite extensive effort, it still remains challenging to identify G-E interactions. With the long accumulation of experiments and data, for many biomedical problems of common interest, there are existing studies that can be relevant and informative for the identification of G-E interactions and/or main effects. In this study, our goal is to identify G-E interactions (as well as their corresponding main G effects) under a joint statistical modeling framework. Significantly advancing from the existing studies, a quasi-likelihoodâbased approach is developed to incorporate information mined from the existing literature. A penalization approach is adopted for identification and selection and respects the âmain effects, interactionsâ hierarchical structure. Simulation shows that, when the existing information is of high quality, significant improvement can be observed. On the other hand, when the existing information is less informative, the proposed method still performs reasonably (and hence demonstrates a certain degree of ârobustnessâ). The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on cutaneous melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed approach and also leads to sensible findings.},

	abstract = {Identification of gene-environment (G Ã E) interactions associated with disease phenotypes has posed a great challenge in high-throughput cancer studies. The existing marginal identification methods have suffered from not being able to accommodate the joint effects of a large number of genetic variants, while some of the joint-effect methods have been limited by failing to respect the âmain effects, interactionsâ hierarchy, by ignoring data contamination, and by using inefficient selection techniques under complex structural sparsity. In this article, we develop an effective penalization approach to identify important G Ã E interactions and main effects, which can account for the hierarchical structures of the 2 types of effects. Possible data contamination is accommodated by adopting the least absolute deviation loss function. The advantage of the proposed approach over the alternatives is convincingly demonstrated in both simulation and a case study on lung cancer prognosis with gene expression measurements and clinical covariates under the accelerated failure time model.},
